What technology is used by Strava to track its cycling users?

Strava uses GPS technology to track the cycling activities of its users. The Strava app uses the GPS sensor in the user's mobile device or GPS-enabled cycling computer to track the user's route, speed, distance, and other metrics. Strava also uses satellite imagery and other mapping data to enhance the accuracy of its route tracking. Additionally, some Strava users may use Bluetooth-enabled sensors such as heart rate monitors, power meters, or cadence sensors to track additional performance metrics.
